# Binomial distribution

# Problem
# Suppose there are ten multiple choice questions in an English class quiz. 
# Each question has four possible answers, and only one of them is correct.
# 
# Q1. Find the probability of having exactly 4 correct answers by random 
# Solution


# Q2. What is the probability of having four or less correct answers if a 
#     student attempts to answer every question at random?
# Solution



#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Poisson distribution

# Problem
# If there are ten cars crossing a bridge per minute on average, find the 
# probability of having seventeen or more cars crossing the bridge in a 
# particular minute.
# Solution

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Normal distribution

# Problem
# The Iris dataset in R contains iris flower specifications. The column 
# Sepal Width follows a normal distribution.
#
# Q1. What is the percentage of flowers with Sepal Width 3cm or less?
# Solution


# Q2. What fraction of the flowers where Sepal Width lies between 3cm and 4cm?
# Solution



#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exponential distribution
#
# Q1. Suppose the mean arrival time of a customer at a supermarket cashier is 
# four minutes. Find the probability of a customer arriving at the cashier 
# in less than three minutes.
# Solution


# Q2. The number of days ahead travelers buy their flight tickets follows an 
# exponential distribution with the average number of days = 15. 
# Find the probability that a traveler will purchase a ticket more than 
# 10 days in advance.
# Solution


#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Chi-Square distribution

# Problem Statement
# Say, on average, a battery lasts 50 minutes on a single charge. The standard 
# deviation is 3 minutes. Suppose the battery manufacturer runs a quality 
# control test. They randomly select 9 batteries. The standard deviation of 
# the selected batteries is 5 minutes. 
# Q1. What would be the chi-square statistic represented by this test?
# Solution


# Q2. Suppose they repeated the test with a new random sample of 9 batteries. 
# What is the probability that the standard deviation in the new test would be 
# greater than 5 minutes?
# Solution
